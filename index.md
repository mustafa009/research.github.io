#### Research Agenda
My research interests revolve around supply chain optimization, supplier selection, operation management, and multi-criteria decision making. My portfolio includes three publications, including one that is currently under review. The first publication is titled "Measurement of Supply Chain Performance by Designing a Real-Time Microsoft Power BI Dashboard," while the second is an undergraduate thesis paper titled "Analyzing the Factors of Cross-Border E-Commerce Supply Chain Resilience Based on Integrated Fuzzy TOPSIS-ISM." The third publication, which is currently under review, explores the challenges of implementing blockchain technology in sustainable supply chains through an integrated fuzzy TOPSIS-ISM approach..

#### Short Biography
I I was born and raised in Shamshernagar, Sylhet, Bangladesh. **In 2018**, I began studying Industrial Engineering (IE) at Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET). During my four and a half years of study, I experimented with several real-life project ideas and gained practical expertise in IE fields.

Throughout my bachelor's degree, I focused on becoming an expert in industrial engineering, specifically in the supply chain and operations management sectors.

As part of my extracurricular activities, I volunteered as a campus ambassador for "Bohubrihi- E-learning" and "Scholarship School BD."

Now, in 2022, I'm excited to take on new challenges in research, network building, and other areas.
